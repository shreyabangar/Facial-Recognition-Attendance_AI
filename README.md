**Facial Recognition Attendance System**<br>
A real-time facial recognition attendance system built with Python and OpenCV, featuring a Tkinter-based GUI. It detects and recognizes faces using Haar Cascade and LBPH algorithms, and securely stores attendance records in a CSV file.


**Features**
1. Real-time face detection and recognition
2. Tkinter-based user-friendly GUI
3. Attendance record saved in CSV file
4. Supports multiple unique users
5. Built with Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascade, and LBPH algorithms


**Installation** - Install the required libraries:
1. pip install opencv-python
2. pip install numpy
3. pip install pandas
4. Install Tkinter if it's not already available


**Usage**
1. Run dataset_creator.py to capture face images and create the dataset.
2. Run train_model.py to train the LBPH face recognizer using the dataset.
3. Run recognize_attendance.py to start the real-time face recognition and mark attendance.
4. Attendance will be recorded in the attendance.csv file.


**Requirements**
1. Python 3.10 or higher
2. OpenCV
3. NumPy
4. Pandas
5. Tkinter
